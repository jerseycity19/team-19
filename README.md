# the ABCDs

### The purpose of this project was to refine Global Nomadsâ€™ website Seat At the Table. The problem given was that we needed to provide a fast and efficient way to provide seamless flow of connection across diff languages and time zones. The solution had to be safe and low cost.
### A Seat at the Table allows for global youth (16-19) video chat across the world to allow them to feel a sense of belonging. They share their experiences through storytelling and as a result, grow more empathy for others coming from different backgrounds. Seat At the Table wants to create a less chaotic world through having the younger generation recognize each others humanity despite their differences.
