### The purpose of this project was to refine Global Nomads’ site Seat At the Table. 
### The problem given was that we needed to provide a fast and efficient way to provide seamless flow of connection across 
### diff languages and time zones.
### The solution had to be safe and low cost. A Seat at the Table allows for global youth (16-19 years old) to 
### video chat across the world to give them to feel a sense of belonging. 
### They share their experiences through storytelling and as a result, grow more empathy for others coming from 
### different backgrounds. Seat At the Table wants to create a less chaotic world through having the younger 
### generation recognize each others humanity despite their differences.
